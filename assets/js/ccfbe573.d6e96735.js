In this case there is no separate thread created for the packet capture and everything is happening on the main thread. This method requires a callback of type ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"OnPacketArrivesStopBlocking")," to be defined by the user. Let's first define this callback:"),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},"/**\n* a callback function for the blocking mode capture which is called each time a packet is captured\n*/\nstatic bool onPacketArrivesBlockingMode(pcpp::RawPacket* packet, pcpp::PcapLiveDevice* dev, void* cookie)\n{\n    // extract the stats object form the cookie\n    PacketStats* stats = (PacketStats*)cookie;\n\n    // parsed the raw packet\n    pcpp::Packet parsedPacket(packet);\n\n    // collect stats from packet\n    stats->consumePacket(parsedPacket);\n\n    // return false means we don't want to stop capturing after this callback\n    return false;\n}\n")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"As you can see the callback accepts several parameters: a pointer to the packet currently captured, a pointer to the interface instance doing this capture and a pointer to an object supplied by the user at the beginning of the packet capture (a cookie). Until now everything seems similar to the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"OnPacketArrivesCallback")," callback we demonstrated previously. But there is one important difference: the returning value. In ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"OnPacketArrivesCallback")," there is no return value but in ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"OnPacketArrivesStopBlocking"),' the return value is boolean. This boolean return value allows the user who writes the callback to stop the synchronous packet capture any time, by returning a "true" value. As long as the return value is "false" the packet capture will continue until the timeout expires (we\'ll get to that soon), but if "true" is returned the capture will stop immediately. In our example we choose to always return "false" but you\'re welcome to try returning "true" and see that it\'s working. Besides returning "false" the callback is doing the same as the previous callback: cast the cookie as ',(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PacketStats*"),", parse the raw packet as parsed packet, and feed it to the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PacketStats")," instance to collect information about the protocols used in this packet"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Now let\'s start the packet capture. Here, of course, we don\'t need to sleep as everything is happening on the main thread. But we do want to stop the capture at some point (please remember we always return "false" in the callback so that won\'t stop the capturing). Here is where the timeout feature comes in hand: when starting the packet capture you can provide a timeout of when to stop the packet capture (if not previously stopped by returning "true" from the callback function). If you provide a timeout of 0 or less it\'s like saying there is no timeout and the capture will continue until a "true" value is returned from the callback.

Basically libpcap and WinPcap/Npcap support the ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter"},"BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)")," format for setting a filter on an interface. When setting a filter only packets that match the filter will be passed to the user, all the other packets will be ignored by the capturing mechanism. The BPF format is great and widely used but for my opinion is too complicated and not easy to understand. In addition it's a string-based format and I don't know any C++ API that wraps it in an organized C++ class structure. That's why I developed one, quite simple and not covering all of the BPF options, but is sufficient for most use-cases (I think). In this section we'll learn how to use it and give a small example (the rest can be read in PcapPlusPlus API documentation)"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"As already mentioned, the filtering mechanism is actually an hierarchy of classes representing different kinds of filters, for example: IPv4 filters (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"IPFilter"),"), TCP/UDP Port filters (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PortFilter"),"), MAC address filters (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"MacAddressFilter"),"), VLAN filters (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"VlanFilter"),"), protocol filter (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ProtoFilter"),'), etc. but also composite operators like "and" (',(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"AndFilter"),'), "or" (',(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"OrFilter"),') and "not" (',(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"NotFilter"),"). The root class for all of them is ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"GeneralFilter"),". Each class exposes a simple API (usually in the constructor) for setting the filter values. For example: in IPv4 filter (",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"IPFilter"),") the user should provide in the constructor what is the IPv4 address to set as a filter and also in which direction to look for this address (source address, destination address or both):"),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},"IPFilter(const std::string& ipAddress, Direction dir)\n")),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"We'll not go over all the filter classes but we'll do a quick demonstration of how to construct a complex filter and set it to a ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PcapLiveDevice")," instance.
