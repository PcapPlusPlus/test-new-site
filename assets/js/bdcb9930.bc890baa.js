Now let's go back to our application: once we started the worker threads on cores 1 and 2, we would like the management core to continuously gather statistics and print them to the user. The way to do that is to set up and endless loop inside the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"main()")," method that will collect and print the stats and will be interrupted when the user presses ctrl+c (and setting the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"keepRunning")," flag).
